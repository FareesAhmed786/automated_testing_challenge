Wrote an automated test case to simulate a successful login using valid credentials.
Validated that the login process worked as expected, allowing access to the dashboard.

Created automated test cases to simulate unsuccessful login attempts with invalid credentials.
Checked for appropriate error messages displayed in response to these invalid login attempts.
#3.	Validation of Error Messages:

##Task 3: Cross-Browser Testing
#1.	Configured TestCafe for Multiple Browsers:
Configured TestCafe to run tests on three different browsers: Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox.
#2.	Consistency Across Browsers:
Executed the test cases on each of the selected browsers to ensure that the login process and dashboard access worked consistently across all browsers.
##Task 4: Documentation
#1.	Documenting Testing Approach:
Created comprehensive documentation outlining the testing approach.
Documented test cases, including step-by-step instructions and expected outcomes.
Highlighted any challenges faced during testing and provided solutions or workarounds.
